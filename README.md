jerusalem from day the center point of earth humanity faith and space for all of humankind and all the known and unknown living beings on this precious small place we have and fight over thats called earth! i always beleived there should be a place where humans turn to for the shared truth to get anwsers for quetions one may have about this life, purpose and and status we have but till now i dont know of any and feel the world needs this now more than any other time before its too late or not important anymore so we are getting us human fellows togeather to let the human race know there is more to life than being born and reaching the day you die a new life will be waiting for you or may not a new life but a new phase and continuation of where you left off. think of it as a manufactures company that makes a machine that only through that company and its user guide or manuel would we be able to use the machine most efficient way possible and perserve its life span to the maxiumum life span possible so we are soon launching the project thats long over due but never too late we shall put hands into one anothers to move navigate life on this earth togeather and openly without leaving anyone behind we through here not only wish to unite humans all around the world for currency but to show the true way of life that god intended for us when we were created and sent down to this earth and believe a brother out when you are on the right path your soul knows it and feels so much at peace and rightouegs and when that feeling is flowing through soul feeding it you know that you are on the right path to sucess here in this life and the next to come after this earthily life is over. may all of humankind be blessed to the path to heaven all togeather helping one another with the best intentions ever and it will keep on coming right back your way ike a cycle that repeats its self just like day and night come and go in a repeated cycle it will be of the same sort and most important is when your soul deep down is fed and feels at peace you know that its the right path and on you move to enlighten the next human who this knowlegde has not come up on yet so that we can all freely guide eachother torwards gods way and purpose that we are suppose to be fulfilling here on earth for our lives to be meaningful and fufilling its the only way to it and only way to end all the suffering we on earth collectivly and indiviually suffer from and be rewarded doing so with type of monetary and or status which will keep evovling as life does hand in hand. it should be able to end a whole lot of bad evil corruption and suffering from world goverments to local street gangs thugs criminals etc...thanks for reading this, salam shalom peace to all the sons of ibrahim sent for his time then our father jesus sent for his time and lastly the one sent to all humankind mohammad may god bless him his soul and his companions souls that steered to the rightoeus path so that we learn the way and follow those honarble steps! again salam shalom peace upon all my brothers and sisters.
